# krz_player
Simulates the bar scene from Kentucky Route Zero in the command line.

# The music files
They can be obtained at https://mega.nz/#F!JIMUxAjY!bK1rb1zDVrH0VR76ymH8LA courtesy of u/knellotron.

# Instructions
You'll need the pygame module.
Extract the music files the same folder as the script. Also, you'll need to rename 'JUNEBUG Hold loop 4.ogg' to 'JUNEBUG Hold loop 3.ogg' so that it is in numerical order. 

# Future work
[1] need to work out a way to sync the tracks more reliably and seamlessly. Currently, the timings fluctuate between each playing.

[2] need to add looping so that the music doesn't cut off if the user does not enter a number.

[3] would like to add scroll text that is synced with music.
