# krz_player
Simulates the bar scene from Kentucky Route Zero in the command line.

# The music files
They can be obtained at https://mega.nz/#F!JIMUxAjY!bK1rb1zDVrH0VR76ymH8LA

# Instructions
You'll need the pygame module.
Extract the music files into a folder named 'files' and change the file directory in the code. Also, you'll need to rename one of the music files' so that it is in numerical order.

# Future work
I need to work out a way to sync the tracks more reliably and seamlessly. Currently, the timings fluctuate between each playing.
